# RESTful best practices for Drupal

This module follows [this post](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api) to achieve a _practical_ RESTful for Drupal.
The aim of the module, is to allow exposing an API, without Drupal's data structure leaking to it.

## Concept
The following also describes the difference between other modules such as RestWs and Services Entity.

* Restful module requires explicitly declaring the exposed API. When enabling the
module nothing will happen until the implementing developer will declare it
* Instead of exposing resources by entity type (e.g. node, taxonomy term), Restful
cares about bundles. So for example you may expose the ``Article`` content type, but
not the ``Page`` content type
* The exposed properties need to be explicitly declared. This allows a _clean_ output
without Drupal's internal implementation leaking out. This means the consuming
client doesn't need to know if an entity is a node or a term, nor will they be presented
with the ``field_`` prefix
* One of the core features is versioning. While it's debatable if this feature
 is indeed a pure REST, we believe it's a best practice one
* Only JSON format is supported
* Audience is developers and not site builders

## Module dependencies
* [Entity API](https://drupal.org/project/entity), with the following patches:
  * [$wrapper->access() might be wrong for single entity reference field](https://www.drupal.org/node/2264079#comment-8911637)
  * [Prevent notice in entity_metadata_no_hook_node_access() when node is not saved](https://drupal.org/node/2086225#comment-8768373)


## API via Drupal

Assuming you have enabled the RESTful example module

### Getting handlers

```php
// Get handler v1.0
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles');

// Get handler v1.1
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles', 1, 1);
```

### Create and update an entity
```php
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles');
// POST method, to create.
$result = $handler->post('', array('label' => 'example title'));
$id = $result['id'];

// PATCH method to update only the title.
$request['label'] = 'new title';
$handler->patch($id, $request);
```

### View an entity
```php
// Handler v1.0
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles');
// GET method.
$result = $handler->get(1);

// Output:
array(
  'id' => 1,
  'label' => 'example title',
  'self' => 'https://example.com/node/1',
);

// Handler v1.1 extends v1.0, and removes the "self" property from the
// exposed properties.
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles', 1, 1);
$result = $handler->get(1);

// Output:
array(
  'id' => 1,
  'label' => 'example title',
);
```

#### Filtering fields
Using the ``?fields`` query string, you can decalre which fields should be
returned.

```php
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles');

// Define the fields.
$request['fields'] = 'id,label';
$result = $handler->get(2, $request);

// Output:
array(
  'id' => 2,
  'label' => 'another title',
);
```

### List entities
```php
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles');
$result = $handler->get();

// Output:
array(
  'list' => array(
    array(
      'id' => 1,
      'label' => 'example title',
      'self' => 'https://example.com/node/1',
    );
    array(
      'id' => 2,
      'label' => 'another title',
      'self' => 'https://example.com/node/2',
    );
  ),
);
```

#### Sort
You can sort the list of entities by multiple properties. Prefixing the property
with a dash (``-``) will sort is in a descending order.
If no sorting is specified the default sorting is by the entity ID.

```php
$handler = restful_get_restful_handler('articles');

// Define the sorting by ID (descending) and label (ascending).
$request['sort'] = '-id,label';
$result = $handler->get('', $request);

// Output:
array(
  'list' => array(
    array(
      'id' => 2,
      'label' => 'another title',
      'self' => 'https://example.com/node/2',
    );
    array(
      'id' => 1,
      'label' => 'example title',
      'self' => 'https://example.com/node/1',
    );
  ),
);
```

## API via URL

### View an Article

```shell
# Handler v1.0
curl https://example.com/api/v1/articles/1

# Handler v1.1
curl https://example.com/api/v1/articles/1 \
  -H "X-Restful-Minor-Version: 1"
```

## Authentication providers

Restful comes with ``cookie``, ``base_auth`` (user name and password in the HTTP header)
authentications providers, as well as a "RESTful token auth" module that has a
``token`` authentication provider.

Note: if you use cookie-based authentication then you also need to set the
HTTP ``X-CSRF-Token`` header on all writing requests (POST, PUT and DELETE).
You can retrieve the token from ``/api/session/token`` with a standard HTTP
GET request.

See [this](https://github.com/Gizra/angular-restful-auth) AngularJs example that shows a login from a fully decoupled web app
to a Drupal backend.


```bash
# (Change username and password)
curl -u "username:password" https://example.com/api/login

# Response has access token.
{"access_token":"YOUR_TOKEN"}

# Call a "protected" with token resource (Articles resource version 1.3 in "Restful example")
curl https://example.com/api/v1/articles/1?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN \
  -H "Restful-Minor-Version: 3"
```

### Error handling
While a PHP ``Exception`` is thrown when using the API via Drupal, this is not the
case when consuming the API externally. Instead of the exception a valid JSON
with ``code``, ``message`` and ``description`` would be returned.

The RESTful module adheres to the [Problem Details for HTTP
APIs](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-06) draft to
improve DX when dealing with HTTP API errors. Download and enable the [Advanced
Help](https://drupal.org/project/advanced_help) module for more information
about the errors.

For example, trying to sort a list by an invalid key

```shell
curl https://example.com/api/v1/articles?sort=wrong_key
```

Will result with an HTTP code 400, and the following JSON:

```javascript
{
  'type' => 'http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1',
  'title' => 'The sort wrong_key is not allowed for this path.',
  'status' => 400,
  'detail' => 'Bad Request.',
}
```

## Cache layer
The RESTful module is compatible and leverages the popular
[Entity Cache](https://drupal.org/project/entitycache) module and adds a new
cache layer on its own for the rendered entity. Two requests made by the same
user requesting the same fields on the same entity will benefit from the render
cache layer. This means that no entity will need to be loaded if it was rendered
in the past under the same conditions.

Developers have absolute control where the cache is stored and the expiration
for every resource, meaning that very volatile resources can skip cache entirely
while other resources can have its cache in MemCached or the database. To
configure this developers just have to specify the following keys in their
_restful_ plugin definition.
